                    <h3>Why Should Kids Learn to Code with Tynker?</h3>

                <div class="contP">
                    <p>Because <strong>technology is so integrated </strong> into virtually 
                        every aspect of our lives, learning about it is <strong>
                        more important than ever.</strong> For kids, our coding platform 
                        makes it convenient and fun to gain knowledge that will
                        serve them well throughout their lives. You can count 
                        on our <strong>trusted methods</strong> to help them develop 
                        and grow their capabilities with computers. <br><br>
                    

                        Tynker isn’t just for schools and coding camps, 
                        though. Parents who value <strong>STEM education</strong> and want 
                        their children to know how to learn to code should
                         know that our kids programming platform can be used 
                         at home, too. There are individual and family home
                          plans, and our online coding classes for kids are a 
                          great way for them to gain the supplemental STEM 
                          skills needed for the world of the future.
